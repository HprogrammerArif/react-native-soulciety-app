# 30-Day Healing Journey — API Documentation

**Base URL:** `{{base_url}}/api/healing`  
**Auth:** All endpoints require `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.

---

## Day Lifecycle

Content generation is **strictly background-only**. No API call triggers AI generation.

| Time | Event |
|---|---|
| 6:00 PM (day before) | Background task pre-generates next day's content (state stays `locked`) |
| 12:00 AM (midnight) | Day unlocks → state becomes `available` |
| 11:59 PM (end of day) | If not completed → state becomes `missed` |

**Day states:** `locked` · `available` · `completed` · `missed`  
**Content statuses:** `pending` · `generating` · `ready` · `failed`

## 5. Complete a Day

### 5.1 Mark Day Complete
**`POST /days/<day_number>/complete/`**

Marks a day as completed. Idempotent — safe to call twice. Updates streak, recovers grace period if active, detects milestones, and marks journey complete on Day 30. Both fields are optional.

**Payload:**
```json
{
  "mood": "happy",
  "journal_entry_id": 42
}
```

`mood` valid values: `happy` · `fear` · `sad` · `angry` · `sick`

{
  "message": "Day 4 complete.",
  "current_streak": 1,

  "milestone_reached": null
}
```

**Milestone response example:**
```json
{
  "message": "Day 7 complete.",
  "current_streak": 7,
  "total_days_completed": 7,
  "milestone_reached": {
    "day": 7,
    "message": "One full week. Your nervous system is changing."
  }
}
```

**Idempotent (already completed) response (200 OK):**
```json
{
  "message": "Day 4 was already completed.",
  "current_streak": 1,
  "already_completed": true
}
```

**Error responses:**

| Condition | Status | Body |
|---|---|---|
| Day is locked | 403 | `{"error": "day_locked", "message": "Day N is locked."}` |
| No journey found | 404 | `{"error": "No healing journey found."}` |

## 6. Mental Exercise Reflection

### 6.1 Save Reflection
**`POST /days/<day_number>/reflection/`**

Saves the user's written reflection from the mental workout exercise. Triggers a background task that extracts personal insights from the reflection and stores them in the user's AI memory for more personalized future interactions.

**Payload:**
```json
{
  "mentalreflectiontext": "I noticed that I tend to withdraw whenever I feel overwhelmed..."
}
```

**Response (201 Created):**
```json
{
  "id": 7,
  "healing_day": 42,
  "mentalreflectiontext": "I noticed that I tend to withdraw whenever I feel overwhelmed...",
  "created_at": "2026-04-30T10:15:00Z"
}
```

**Error (400):** `{"error": "mentalreflectiontext is required."}`  
**Error (404):** `{"error": "Healing day not found."}`

---

## 7. Progress & Streak

### 7.1 Get Progress
**`GET /progress/`**

Returns streak data, milestones, and grace period status.

**Response (200 OK):**
```json
{
  "total_days_completed": 5,
  "current_streak": 3,
  "longest_streak": 5,
  "milestones_reached": [3],
  "grace_period_active": false,
  "grace_expires_at": null,
  "journey_complete": false,
  "journey_started_at": "2026-04-27T10:03:14Z",
  "journey_completed_at": null
}
```

**Grace period:** When a user misses a day, `grace_period_active` becomes `true` and they have until `grace_expires_at` (end of next local day) to complete the missed day without losing their streak. Completing any day during the grace window clears it.
